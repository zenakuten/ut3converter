"""Image writers for UT2004 texture import.

DXT1/3/5 pass straight through as .dds (UT2004 supports all three natively);
uncompressed formats are written as 32-bit .tga, matching the file types
`#exec TEXTURE IMPORT` already accepts.

A DXT .dds must carry its own mip chain, because nothing downstream will build
one: `UTexture::CreateMips` returns immediately for every DXT format
(Engine/Src/UnTex.cpp:492), and `UTexture::Compress` bails unless the source is
RGBA8 or P8 (UnTex.cpp:1000), so `#exec TEXTURE IMPORT`'s Mips= and DXT= are
both no-ops on one. A single-mip world texture is a real defect and a visible
one -- it is the whole difference between a 1024x1024 DXT5 of ours at 1,048,629
bytes and the stock UT2004 equivalent at 1,398,370 (the chain adds a third).
TGA is left alone: RGBA8 *is* a format CreateMips handles, and the import does.
