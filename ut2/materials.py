"""UE2 material objects -- Shader, FinalBlend, TexPanner -- built by `ucc make`.

A `Begin Object` block in a generated class's defaultproperties lands in the
class's *package*, not on its default object, and is RF_Public: it is an
ordinary package object that `Shader'Pkg.Name'` addresses from a t3d, an actor
property or another package's import table. `convert/shaders.py` has the
mechanism and `PLAN.md` Phase 14 the evidence; `ShaderLab/` at the install root
is the probe.

The one rule that is not obvious: **SavePackage writes only objects something
references.** A material nothing points at is dropped silently, with no error
and no warning, so `emit` always writes the `KeepAlive` array alongside the
blocks.

Emission order is registration order, which is dependency order because a graph
is built from the texture outwards. That matters: ImportProperties walks the
defaultproperties text line by line, so a block referring to an object defined
below it resolves to nothing.
